# Introduction to Python

This consists of small exercises and assignments to prove the understanding of one in Python Programming.
All the projects should be hosted on github and done using an online text editor like codesandbox.io



### Introduction
**Reading Resources**  
Please use the resources below for home study before attempting the assignments.
- [Gentler introduction to programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-gentler-introduction-to-programming-1f57383a1b2c/)
- [Python Programming for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/python-programming-beginners/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-HiTlksk6LmMvSwmMKWw25Q&LSNPUBID=JVFxdTr9V80)



### Prove your understanding  
**Assignment 1**  
Having through the recommended material, please look at the Data Flow Diagram below. Using loops, write a simple Python code 
that asks the player some questions about animals. They get three chances to answer each question—you don’t want to make the quiz too difficult! Each correct answer will score one point. At the end of the quiz, the program reveals the player’s final score.If the user attempts a question three times and gives a wrong answer, display the correct answer then move to next question(if there is more) else display total score.
